The datasets included in this repository cover a wide range of machine learning problems and are suitable for use in educational projects, research, and development. Each dataset is accompanied by a brief description, format details, and potential use cases.

## Datasets

### Regression Datasets

This section contains datasets suitable for regression tasks, where the goal is to predict a continuous target variable.

- **[Salary Dataset](https://github.com/dr-saad-la/datasets/blob/main/salary.csv):** This dataset contains information about "Years of Experience" and "Salary" for 30 employees in a company. The dataset was obtained from the [MLPack dataset website](https://datasets.mlpack.org/Salary_Data.csv).


### Classification Datasets

This section contains datasets suitable for classification tasks, where the goal is to predict a categorical target variable.

- **[loan default](https://github.com/dr-saad-la/datasets/blob/main/loan_default.csv):** Loan_default dataset contains historic data for loan defaultees, along with their associated financial background.


## Usage
